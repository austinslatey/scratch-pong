# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game built in Scratch for the Harvard's CS50 Week 0 submission. The game simulates table tennis, with the paddle represented as a broom and the pong ball represented as a tennis ball.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to hit the ball back and forth across the playing field using the broom, and score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle and hit the back wall of their side of the field. If the ball gets past the broom, the player loses.

The game consists of two levels:

- Level 1: The player needs to score 10 points to win the game.
- Level 2: The game is infinite, and the player's objective is to score as many points as possible.

To control the broom, use your mouse left and right.
